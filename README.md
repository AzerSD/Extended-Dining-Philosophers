# Extended-Dining-Philosophers
The 42 Philosophers problem is a synchronization and concurrency challenge that extends the classic Dining Philosophers problem to a larger group of philosophers. The problem requires finding a solution that allows all the philosophers to eat without deadlock or starvation, even as the number of philosophers increases.

## Maybe you can handle 5 philosophers, but can you handle more?!
